StarCellBio
===========

Getting started? Check out the `Developer's Guide <https://github.com/starteam/starcellbio_html/blob/develop/docs/DeveloperGuide.rst>`_.

Curious about architecture? Try `this document <https://github.com/starteam/starcellbio_html/blob/develop/docs/StarCellBio-Architecture.rst>`_.

If you want to run the selenium ide scripts, you'll need to `get selenium-ide firefox plugin <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/>`. From there, you can load the cases in the selenium_ide directory and run them.
