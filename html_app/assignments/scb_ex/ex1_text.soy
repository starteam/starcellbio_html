<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
You are completing a summer research project in a lab that studies various signal transduction pathways involved in human diseases. Your advisor has asked you to determine the subcellular localization of a newly discovered set of proteins, called Protein A, B, C, and D within human cells. These proteins are components of a signal transduction pathway that regulates cell proliferation. Mutations in other known components of this pathway result in increased proliferation and tumorigenesis. To characterize the roles of Proteins A-D in this signal transduction pathway, you first investigate their subcellular localization. To do this, you generate human cell lines, each stably expressing a fusion protein in which Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is fused in frame to one of the five proteins. These fusion cell lines are called GFP-ProA, GFP-ProB, etc. You then look at the localization of these fusion proteins using fluorescence microscopy.
</p>
<p>
Your collaborator in a clinical cancer lab has identified two cancer patients with mutations in this pathway; one with a mutation in the gene encoding Protein A and one with a mutation in the gene encoding Protein B. These mutations do not affect the production of Protein A and B. To understand how these mutations affect the function of Protein A and B, you clone the Mutant A and Mutant B genes and create cell lines stably expressing each of the mutant proteins fused to GFP. These cell lines are called GFP-Mut ProA and GFP-Mut ProB. Your research project is to determine if these mutations affect the localization of Protein A and B using fluorescence microscopy.

<h3>Microscopy</h3>
You are provided with the following conditions for fluorescence microscopy experiments:
 <table class='scb_ex1_text_table'>
<thead>
    <td style='width:75pt'>
        <strong>Condition</strong>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Description</strong>

GFP (green)</td><td>	Fluorescence microscopy image captured using the green channel <sup>1,2</sup>.

<h3>
Notes:
</h3>
<p>
<sup>1</sup>When GFP is excited with a laser emitting the appropriate wavelength of light, it fluoresces, emitting green light. A scientist can view the green light emitted by GFP molecules in the cells through a microscope’s viewfinder when the appropriate emission filter is used on the microscope.
</p><p>
<sup>2</sup>The images portrayed in StarCellBio’s microscopy experiments are in black and white because they were captured by a black and white camera attached to the microscope. When images are captured by a black and white camera, the areas with the brightest or strongest fluorescence appear as white pixels and the areas with the weakest fluorescence appear as black pixels.

{template .questions}
<h2>Question 1</h2>
Conduct the appropriate fluorescence microscopy experiments to determine the subcellular localization of each protein, Proteins A-D. Ensure you perform any relevant control experiments.
Answer the following two questions for each of Proteins A-D:
<ol type="i">
<li> Where is the protein localized within human cells? For each protein, choose the answer that best describes
its subcellular localization: plasma membrane, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nucleus, or nuclear membrane.</li>
<li> Explain how you arrived at your answer. Your answer should reference your experimental results and include the
relevant controls that you used to arrive at your conclusion. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Question 2</h2>
Perform the appropriate microscopy experiments to determine the subcellular localization of the mutant Protein A in
the GFP-Mut ProA cell line. Ensure you perform any relevant controls experiments.
<ol type="a">
<li> Where is the mutant Protein A located in the GFP-Mut ProA cell line? Does the mutant Protein A localize to the same
place as wild-type Protein A? Explain how you arrived at your answer using your experimental results.</li>
<li> Propose a hypothesis that would explain how a mutation in the gene encoding Protein A would result in the change
in subcellular localization, if any, identified in Question 2 (a).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Question 3</h2>
Conduct the appropriate properly controlled microscopy experiments within StarCellBio to determine the subcellular
localization of the mutant Protein B in the GFP-Mut ProB cell line. Ensure you perform any relevant controls experiments.
<ol type="a">
<li> Where is the mutant Protein B located in the GFP-Mut ProB cell line? Does the mutant Protein B localize to the same
place as wild-type Protein B? Explain how you arrived at your answer using your experimental results.</li>
<li> Propose a hypothesis that would explain how a mutation in the gene encoding Protein B would result in the change
in subcellular localization, if any, identified in Question 3 (a).</li>
