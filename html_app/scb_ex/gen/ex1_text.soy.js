  output.append('<h2>Introduction</h2><p>You are completing a summer research project in a lab that studies various signal transduction pathways involved in human diseases. Your advisor has asked you to determine the subcellular localization of a newly discovered set of proteins, called Protein A, B, C, and D within human cells. These proteins are components of a signal transduction pathway that regulates cell proliferation. Mutations in other known components of this pathway result in increased proliferation and tumorigenesis. To characterize the roles of Proteins A-D in this signal transduction pathway, you first investigate their subcellular localization. To do this, you generate human cell lines, each stably expressing a fusion protein in which Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is fused in frame to one of the five proteins. These fusion cell lines are called GFP-ProA, GFP-ProB, etc. You then look at the localization of these fusion proteins using fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>Your collaborator in a clinical cancer lab has identified two cancer patients with mutations in this pathway; one with a mutation in the gene encoding Protein A and one with a mutation in the gene encoding Protein B. These mutations do not affect the production of Protein A and B. To understand how these mutations affect the function of Protein A and B, you clone the Mutant A and Mutant B genes and create cell lines stably expressing each of the mutant proteins fused to GFP. These cell lines are called GFP-Mut ProA and GFP-Mut ProB. Your research project is to determine if these mutations affect the localization of Protein A and B using fluorescence microscopy.</p>');

For each protein, choose the answer that best describes its subcellular localization: plasma membrane, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nucleus, or nuclear membrane. ii. Explain how you arrived at your answer. Your answer should reference your experimental results and include the relevant controls that you used to arrive at your conclusion.<h2>Question 2</h2>Perform the appropriate microscopy experiments to determine the subcellular localization of the mutant Protein A in the GFP-Mut ProA cell line. Ensure you perform any relevant controls experiments. a) Where is the mutant Protein A located in the GFP-Mut ProA cell line? Does the mutant Protein A localize to the same place as wild-type Protein A? Explain how you arrived at your answer using your experimental results. b) Propose a hypothesis that would explain how a mutation in the gene encoding Protein A would result in the change in subcellular localization, if any, identified in Question 2 (a).<h2>Question 3</h2>Conduct the appropriate properly controlled microscopy experiments within StarCellBio to determine the subcellular localization of the mutant Protein B in the GFP-Mut ProB cell line. Ensure you perform any relevant controls experiments. a) Where is the mutant Protein B located in the GFP-Mut ProB cell line?
